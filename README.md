# Github Portfolio using TailwindCSS and Javascript

1. Open Cursor
2. Open 2 Terminals.

- With the first one, run `npm run build_css`.
	- Then run, `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ./public/styles.css --watch`.
	- This one will infinitely run since it has the `--watch` tag.

- With the second terminal, run `live-server public`.
	- Go to `localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to see the output.

**Screenshots**

- Cool thing about this is that it is designed as mobile-first, responsive and looks clean to small, medium, or large screens.
